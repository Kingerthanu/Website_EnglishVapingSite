# website_EnglishVapingSite
  Old website I made to test my web-dev when in an English class when they said we could present in any mean necessary so I made a website using CSS, and Javascript to help add interactivity. Helped me a lot learn about mark-up languages like html and this understanding of objects and class types / ID's that web development works a lot around. It also taught me how to learn bootstrap and how/what it does and how it does it.
